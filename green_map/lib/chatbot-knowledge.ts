      'Best trees for fall color',
      'Fall foliage information',
      'Autumn leaf colors explained'
    ],
    answer: 'The spectacular color show of autumn happens as trees prepare for winter dormancy. During growing seasons, leaves appear green due to chlorophyll, which masks other pigments present in the leaves. As days shorten and temperatures cool, trees stop producing chlorophyll, revealing hidden pigments: carotenoids (yellow and orange) and anthocyanins (reds and purples). Trees with the most vivid fall displays include Sugar Maple (bright orange-red), Red Maple (brilliant red), Sweetgum (purple, red, yellow), Aspen (golden yellow), and Japanese Maple (crimson red). Weather conditions affect color intensity - the best displays typically follow warm, sunny days and cool nights without freezing temperatures, combined with adequate but not excessive rainfall.'
